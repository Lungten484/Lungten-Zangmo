            <h1>Drama</h1>
            <p>Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance: 
                a play, opera, mime, ballet, etc., performed in a theatre, or on radio or television.
                 Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic 
                 and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's Poetics (c.335 BC)—the earliest work of dramat
                The term "drama" comes from a Greek word meaning "deed" or "act" (Classical Greek: δρᾶμα, drâma), 
                which is derived from "I do" (Classical ic theory.
 Greek: δράω, dráō). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy.</p>
